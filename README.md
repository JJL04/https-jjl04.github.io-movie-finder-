# Movie Finder

This is a simple static Movie Finder site (single-page HTML) that shows a searchable grid of movie posters.

How to view locally
- Open `index.html` (or `Movie Finder.html`) in your browser.
- Or run a local static server from the repository root:

```powershell
cd 'C:\Users\lukej\movie finder\https-jjl04.github.io-movie-finder-'
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/ in your browser
```

Publish with GitHub Pages
- Make sure the repository is pushed to GitHub under `JJL04/<repo-name>`.
- In the repo settings -> Pages, set the source to the `main` branch and the `/` (root) folder.
- The site will be available at `https://jjl04.github.io/<repo-name>/` once Pages finishes building.

If you still see a 404 after enabling Pages, confirm:
- The branch and folder selected in Settings -> Pages are correct.
- There is an `index.html` at the repository root.

## Course submission (WDD 330)

Use the following files to prepare your WDD 330 final submission. Fill in the placeholders with your name, deployed app URL (e.g. Netlify or GitHub Pages), public video link (YouTube/Loom), GitHub repo, and Trello board link.

- `PROFESSIONAL_DEVELOPMENT.md` — Professional development document with evidence table and reflections.
- `SKILLS_DEVELOPMENT.md` — Skills document with links required by the course (deployed site, repo, Trello, video).

Steps to complete before submission:
1. Fill in `PROFESSIONAL_DEVELOPMENT.md` and `SKILLS_DEVELOPMENT.md` with your name and public links.
2. Record a ~5 minute walkthrough video showing the app, the code, and speaking about your choices. Host it publicly (YouTube or Loom).
3. Confirm your deployed site is publicly accessible (open in an incognito window).
4. Update your Trello board with progress and link it in the docs.
5. Upload the two completed markdown files to Canvas as required by the assignment.

If you want, I can generate a short script for your video walkthrough and a sample Trello board template you can import.
