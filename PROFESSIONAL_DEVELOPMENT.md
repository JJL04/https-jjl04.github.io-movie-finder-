Project title: Movie Finder
Short description: A static single-page application that displays a searchable grid of movie posters with a details modal. The app uses a centralized `movies.json` dataset and local `posters/` assets for offline compatibility.

|---|---|---|
| Build a responsive UI | Implemented CSS grid, dark theme, responsive breakpoints, accessible keyboard interactions | `index.html`, `styles.css` |
| Client-side data rendering | Centralized data in `movies.json`, client-side rendering and search | `movies.json`, `index.html` |
| Asset management & optimization | Downloaded posters to `posters/`, optimized images and generated WebP fallbacks | `posters/` folder |
| Accessibility & interaction | Keyboard focus, ARIA attributes, modal dialog, input roles | `index.html` |
| Deployment | Deployed to GitHub Pages (fill in URL) | [APP_URL_HERE] |
